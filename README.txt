-The tsm2mat is used to convert .tsm files into .mat

-The Analog_IV file is used to record electrophysiology data during the fluorescent imaging.

-The ImageAligne file is used to align images to counteract for movements of the sampleduring the recordings. After setting the acquisition time, upload the first recording to be used as a reference. Upload the next recordings to align them according to the first and save the corrected images.

-The NaAnalysistri is used to extract the sodium fluorescent change. Upload the recorded image, the electrophyiology and the bleach recording and then chose a region where you want to calculate the fluorescent change.

-The BuildNaLu file is used to fit the sodium signal with a product of sigmoids and calculate the sodium current.

-The APanalisi file is used to analyse the shape of the action potential.

-The redshirt_read_dual is used to read "RedshirtImaging" files and save data into "MATLAB" files.

-The Basic_2020 file is used extract fluorescence changes from data converted from "RedshirtImaging" files.

-The fit4sigm file and the sigmf files are used to fit fluorescence changes with a 4-sigmoid function.
